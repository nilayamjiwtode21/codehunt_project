# codehunt_project
The AI-powered budget planner and expense tracker was developed to help users analyze their financial habits, optimize savings, and achieve financial goals.
The project aimed to solve the common problem of ineffective expense management by integrating AI-powered analytics to provide personalized financial insights based on user spending behavior. The application was built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. Additionally, AI algorithms were integrated to analyze expenses and offer recommendations, while authentication mechanisms such as Firebase Authentication or JWT were implemented for user security.
